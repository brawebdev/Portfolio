    "bio": "I am a clean code craftsman. I take pride in my work because how I write code matters. It matters to the developers that I work with today and to the developers that come after me. It matters to the user and the business. I am a team player. Team players know how to disagree but commit to being held accountable for team decisions. They know how to give and receive feedback with finesse and an open mind. A team player asks, 'How do I provide the greatest possible amount of value to the team?' then they follow through. I am a work in progress. The keyword here is work. It takes work to grow and the process isn't always comfortable. I lean into the discomfort. A better version of myself is formed through the striving. Every sword must be tempered in the fire. 'You should never sacrifice what you could be for what you are.' - Jordan Peterson ",
